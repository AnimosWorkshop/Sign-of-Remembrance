**Ability Scores:** Your Charisma score decreases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.  
**Age:** Decay around 50 years after their undeath.  
**Size:** As you were in life.  
**Creature Type:** Undead.  
**Speed:** As you had in life.  
**Vision:** Nullvision, mistvision instead of the vision types you had in life.  
**Zombie Fortitude:** You lose 4 maximum hit points and your natural armor's base AC is lowered by 1, but are resistant to Necrotic damage.  
**Undead Purpose:** A holver unlives as a result of an errand the holver was reluctantly sent to during its life. It might be servitude under a punishing master, a mission ordered by force, and more. The holver's purpose is to live free from a master and feel that sense of freedom. Most become satisfied after about a month, and each passing day has more chance of redeeming the holver. However, during this time, they might act unlike themselves, with a distinct primal instinct to not be bound again.  
**Claw your Way Out:** A hovler's hands become more more deadly, since slaves usually don't have access to elaborate tools. Unarmed attacks made with your hands can deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and your hands have the tool (Sleight of Hand) property.  
**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Peralian. This counts towards your proficiency cap.
