Each martial technique has keywords which serve as a short description of what it requires in order to be performed. These go into multiple categories:
 
- Level of Skill - whether a technique is basic or advanced.
- Class - which class is able to perform the technique
- Means - which tools or conditions are used in the technique

## Level of Skill
 
### Basic

The technique does not require a high level of skill in order to be learned and performed. These usually involve a low DC in order to pass, and have a rather general clause to invoke.
 
### Advanced

The technique requires advanced knowledge in order to execute correctly. Advanced techniques also require a higher level in the class to learn in the first place, which is specified in the Martial Techniques feature.

## Means

### Flanking
 
The technique requires an ally to provide aid in order to be executed. Both you and the ally are required to be within melee range of the enemy, and you should be standing in opposite sides. The image provided is examples for flanking, with the following legend:

- Red - enemy
- Blue - ally
- Green - you (potential position)   

You may also use flanking techniques if you are hidden from your target or perform it against a surprised creature.
 
### Movement
 
The technique causes you to move in one direction or another, or involves a lot of movement. These techniques require you to be able to move in order to perform, and cause you to use up movement from your current turn, or if performed outside of your turn, from your next turn. If you cannot move the distance required, the technique fails automatically.
 
### Time
 
The technique extends the time expended to perform a particular action in order to increase its power. A common example would be, using a regular action to perform a quick action, or expending both an action and a quick action to perform an action.
 
### Armed
 
The technique requires a particular weapon or shield to be used, as detailed in the technique.
