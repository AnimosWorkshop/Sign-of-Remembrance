- Required Weapon: Unarmed strike (2-handed)
 
You lash out with both hands to deliver a powerful blow from above against your opponent. On a success, you attack, dealing 1d4 base bludgeoning damage with your unarmed attack and knocking the target prone on a hit if they are of your size category or smaller. Even if you fail the maneuver DC, you still make your two handed attack, dealing 1d4 base bludgeoning damage on a hit.  
This counts as a medium weapon attack.
