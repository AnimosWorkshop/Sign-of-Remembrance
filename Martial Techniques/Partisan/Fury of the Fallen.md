If either you or a flanking ally have taken damage during the previous round, you may leverage that adrenaline to retaliate - infusing you both with terrifying motivation. You use the Attack action, and have a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls for the attack. On a hit, each successive hitting attack from either you or the ally get the same stacking bonus for hitting the flanked creature until the start of your next turn. On a miss, the effect ends.  
On the start of your next turn, both creatures recover hit points equal to the amount of successful attacks during this technique's effect.
