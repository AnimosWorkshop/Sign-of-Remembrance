You attempt to make an enemy of your size or smaller trip using powerful strikes towards its legs. If your attack hits, the damage die decreases by 1 for the attack, and the creature makes a Resilience saving throw against your Athletics (Strength) based DC, causing the enemy to fall prone on a fail.
