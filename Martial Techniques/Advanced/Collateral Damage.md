- Success DC: Perception (Wisdom), DC 21
- Required Weapon: Flask
 
You throw a bomb in such a way which spreads the flask's content to nearby targets. Make an attack roll against your target. On a hit, in addition to the attack each enemy 5' around your target must make an Initiative saving throw against your basic Perception (Wisdom) DC, taking half the bomb's damage on a fail. If you miss your attack, the attack's target has to roll the Initiative saving throw as well as the surrounding enemies.
