When attempting to use the Preemptive Disruption feature, you may instead attempt to redirect the attack or spell used.  
If the action your opponent used was an attack, you may either redirect it to another creature in the weapon's range, or make it miss.  
If the action was a spell being cast, and the spell doesn't have a range of Self, you may change one of the spell's targets to another target creature the caster can see, or to another location if it doesn't target a creature but an area instead.
