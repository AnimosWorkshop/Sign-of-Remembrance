## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a cleric, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Willpower 13.** Having strong will is mandatory for a cleric who wants to live up to them being a conduit of their god.
- **Proficient with Culture.** Clerics always emerge from a culture - the god they serve as a conduit has come from a certain place, and shaped its growth over the years. One must strive to understand, even if just a little, what those consequences might be.
- **Novice with Sorcery.** As clerics are casters and serve as living conduits, they must have a basic understanding of their powers.
- **Complete special training.** In order to become a cleric, either a strong conduit of a god, such as their archangel, or rarely even the god themselves, must grant one the power of a conduit. This makes direct connection between the one who bestows to the one who receives, and joins them in the grand divine network.

## Class Features
 
### Divine Conduit
 
Clerics have basic power awakened within them as conduits of their gods, which they can develop over time. This allows them to become part of the divine network and communicate with their gods, or the follower who granted them their power. The type of power is inspired by the gods, their ideals and their intended legacy, which comes in the form of mastering one of the magic types. Choose between [Arcanist](Arcana.md), [Auramancer](Auramancy.md) or [Histolect](Histolecty.md), according to the god you serve. For each of your cleric levels, your caster level in that magic type increases by 1.
 
### Divine Sense
 
Becoming a cleric, the power connecting you to your god allows you to notice the consequences of the gods' actions. Using a Search action for Sorcery (Wisdom), you are also able to see which gods influenced the place you search or the person you watch, if any influenced them in a meaningful manner. You might also be able to detect the epic influences affecting a creature, such as blessings and corruptions.
 
### Prayer of Recovery
 
Starting at 2nd level, you have learned to regain some of your magical energy through prayer. Once per day, you may pray during a short rest in order to get back a magical resource of your cleric spellcasting, lower or equivalent to that of a spell of half your cleric level. For example, a 3rd-level arcana cleric would get a used resonance of up to 2nd-level, while an auramancy cleric of the same level would get back up to 3 used mana. This feature cannot recover unspent resources.
 
### Prayer of Protection
 
At 2nd level, you learn how to invoke a special prayer. When you or a creature within 30' of you gets critically hit, you may use your reaction to invoke the prayer and absorb part of the hit. The attacking creature rolls damage as if the attack was not a critical hit, and the damage splits evenly between the attacked creature and you. Armor breakage still applies to the attacked creature.  
You may use this feature an amount of times equal to your Willpower modifier, and regain expended uses in the end of a long rest.
 
### Ability Score Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
 
### Intervention Specialty
 
At 3rd level, you gain a way to influence creatures around you. Choose one according to the god you serve:
 
#### Minor Disruption
Your actions elevate yourself above others, either to further your own goals or even the playing field. When you and another creature compete using a skill (for example: brawl action check, disarm check, insight check, stealth check, etc.), you may use this feature to subtract 1d4 from your opponent's roll or DC. You may also aid an ally within 30' this way by using a reaction.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in the Deception skill.
 
#### Minor Guidance
Your actions lead and guide others. When you and an ally within 30' roll to complete the same task, you may use this feature to subtract 1d4 from the result you rolled, and add the same amount + your Willpower modifier to your ally's roll.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in the Persuasion skill.
 
### Invoke Karma
 
At 4th level, you gain the ability to give yourself either an advantage or a disadvantage in a critical situation, in order to have it repaid later, allowing you to choose your battles with more agency. Whenever you roll for attack, you may choose to roll with advantage instead. If you do, the next attack made against you is made with advantage. Alternatively, whenever an attack you see is made against you, you may choose to impose disadvantage on the attack. If you do, the next attack you make is made with disadvantage.  
No matter your choice, you cannot invoke karma if one that has already been invoked hasn't ended. You may use this feature an amount of times equal to your Willpower modifier per long rest. At 8th level, you may use this feature an additional amount of times per long rest equal to your proficiency modifier.
 
### Major Intervention
At 5th level, the influence you have gained from the Minor Intervention feature increases, allowing you to become more powerful and versatile. You gain one of the following, depending on your Minor Intervention feature.
 
#### Major Disruption
The following options are added to your uses of the feature:

- The opponent's roll or DC is decreased by 1d4 + your Willpower modifier.
- You may use a reaction to reduce another creature's Willpower saving throw by 1d6 if they are within 5' of you and they commit a visible or audible action.
 
#### Major Guidance

The following options are added to your uses of the feature:

- You may target one ally within 30', and transfer either 1d4 or 1d6 from your result to theirs and add your Willpower modifier to it.
- You may target two allies within 30' instead of one if both roll to complete the same task. When using this option, you may have the 1d4 be subtracted from an ally's roll instead of from yours, and add it to the other's roll.
 
### Intervening Beacon
 
At 6th level, your understanding of magic and the power of will has lead you to being able to more easily participate in group castings and inspire others to act. According to your intervention type, you get one of the following benefits.  
In addition, you become proficient with Willpower and Resilience saving throws.
 
#### Beacon of Disruption
You send dread to those around you, granting creatures you consider an enemy within 15' of you a penalty equal to half your Willpower modifier to Willpower saving throws while you are conscious.
#### Beacon of Guidance
You inspire those around you, too, granting you and creatures you consider as allies within 15' of you a bonus equal to half your Willpower modifier to Willpower saving throws while you are conscious.
 
### Conduit's Intervention
 
Though being a cleric means that you derive your magic from the inspiration of a god, in the end, that magic becomes a part of your identity and manifests as an extension of yourself, too. At 7th level, according to your Divine Conduit magic type, you get one of the following benefits:
 
#### Arcana
You understand that influence can't always derive from people - the world is vast, and as we make our way through the world, we have to rely on external forces. Whenever you use your Major Intervention feature, you may move one of the targeted creatures or yourself up to 5' times half your Willpower modifier in any direction to an unoccupied space.
 
#### Auramancy
You understand that sometimes it's not only what people say and communicate that matters - each has their own features which they are born with, and it is that set of parameters which influences their ways. Whenever you use your Major Intervention feature, you may bolster one of the targeted creatures or yourself to reduce the next instance of damage they are dealt until the next time you use your Major Intervention feature or for the next minute, whichever ends sooner, by half your Willpower modifier.
 
#### Histolecty
You understand that self-reliance cannot always be done - in the end, manipulations of bonds, for better or worse, is the key for success. Whenever you use your Major Intervention feature, you may enhance the result of the targeted creature for better or worse by half your Willpower modifier.
 
### Conduit of the Realm
 
At 8th level, you become a conduit of not only the god you serve - but achieve a whole enough understanding of the fundamentals of divinity that you can channel the energy of the world itself. Depending on the planar origin of the god you serve, you gain the ability to channel that origin onto a focused expression of power, using a free action. Either you or a willing or unconscious creature you touch gain the benefit. The benefit does not stack with itself.
 
#### Temuthan
Temuthan has many creatures - big and small, living in the mountains, hills, forests, deserts and tundras. Yet, even that diversity does not mean that they are unable to work with each other, all being able to understand the hope of the light of day, and the danger in the dark of night. The creature gets a 1d4 bonus to their attack rolls until the start of your next turn.
 
#### Preida
Preida gives new meaning to how the land can give back to you - rewarding its inhabitants with not only bountiful crops, but in biomes which truly adapt to accommodate their inhabitants. When the creature uses a supportive action or quick action, such as the Medicate action, the Inspire quick action, casting boon spells, etc., both the creature and their supported target restore hit points equal to your Willpower modifier.
 
#### Hell
Hell represents the balance between eternal summer and eternal winter - opposing forces which by themselves might not be able to coexist, but using some external force, can be used to create harmony. Whenever they receive damage until the start of your next turn, the damaging creature takes 1d4 piercing damage.
 
#### Heliax
Heliax shows a clear disparity, both between the different layers of the world, the great mountain, and the realm below the clouds. In a way, class only has meaning when both the stakes are high, and the result is tangible - and one must both stand tall above, and withstand the suffering awaiting on their way to the top. The creature gets a +2 bonus to saving throws and AC until the start of your next turn.

#### Limbo
Limbo consists of many realm parts, separated by spatial distortions and teleportation hubs - and yet, the world as a whole is without a doubt united, despite the difficulty of travel. The creature may teleport to a point it can see within 20' of it.
 
#### Dahrial
Dahrial could be seen as a place of despair, as most people would never cross the world unless their life has already given in, and the last resort possible could be this attempt to grab onto whatever pride was left to climb back up. Those who actually do succeed, however, are the direct opposite - seeing the grand opportunity they were given to proudly live on to the best of their ability, and become better than they ever could be. This hope drives you further, giving the creature temporary hit points equal to twice your Willpower modifier until the start of your next turn.
 
### Saving Grace
 
At 10th level, you become a true embodiment of an ideal - a full conduit. When you are reduced to 0 hit points for the first time after a long rest, roll a d20. You regain thrice that many hit points. If you were brought prone, you now float standing in place until the start of your next turn.
