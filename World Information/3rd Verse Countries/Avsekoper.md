## Becoming in the 3rd Verse

Over the years before the Second Cataclysm, an undetected White Dragonland cell resided within the [[#Adfer|Adfer]] region to the southwest and prepared to strike whenever the signal would be delivered. When the Great Dragon War began, this cell launched a fierce attack that tested the resilience of both the army and the civilian population.

Luckily, aid came soon enough, as Anapati refugees fled from the Blue Federation to Copperland and aided in the war effort. As people of two countries who knew conflict and survived the Cataclysm, cooperation came naturally with the aid of Meralien Martor and Þea of Mathaq, two new gods who now peacekeep in the country who took on a new name to mark an end to the age of the dragonlands, called Avsekoper - "Copperoots".

The people native to Copperoots are often called koperiun (“coppern”), and the refugees are called federationists, or bifiun federationists. Among them, there is a fairly large group who consider themselves to be coppern at heart, due to the changes in the world and a newfound love for their new home. Those are sometimes called bifedaxiun (“old blues”), and they wish to have rights equal to the koperiun.

## Regions

### Iarla

The capital region of Avsekoper, which also houses its capital city. Iarla is in the northwestern border of Avsekoper's central lake, and enjoys the safety given to it by the Adfer plateau.

### Adfer

A region named after the great plateau it is atop of, watching over Iarla in its northeastern border. Adfer is globally important for several reasons, one of which being the TDA headquarters which reside in a town in the suburbs of the city of Adfer proper. The region of Adfer used to have a large population dedicated to following Aria, the Scholar. According to the disappointment in the Great Dragon War and the koperiun interest of cooperating with [[Urevneþ]], eventually that faith shifted over to [[Helian Gods|Kitas]].
