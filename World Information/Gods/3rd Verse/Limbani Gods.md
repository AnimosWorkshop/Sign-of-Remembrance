In Limbo, the gods have long used an organized system of communication and policy known as the Limbani Council of Gods, which holds a meeting at certain intervals in order to make sure the interests of all its members are being taken into account for realm policy.

### Ollial

Having been chosen in the 12th century 2V, Ollial is a relatively young god, but one who has accumulated much positive reputation in his preparation for the Second Cataclysm as a [[Soran Theology#Nomination Reasoning|deeds-chosen god]]. Assuming that when the time comes, people would prefer protecting their own in-life home instead of the realm they got to upon unliving, Ollial worried for the well-being and protection of the realm, and began recruiting as many people as he could for the cause, rallying the undead and forming Dahrial's Sovereign, a body serving as its self-regulating and protecting organization living mostly outside of only preparing the newly-unborn for recovery handled by the Dahrian gods. This earned Ollial the moniker 'the Reaper', as he was known for gathering undead and guiding them to a new life in Dahrial.

Despite this, in the Third Verse Ollial spends most of his time in Limbo, where he can participate in the Limbani Court of gods as it became tradition during the Second Verse, when he was still a successor, and Dahrial's Sovereign is now truly self-sufficient and is run by the local undead.

Some view Ollial's domain as involving but not limited to protection, similar to the old Fahren belief, but guided by compromise instead of pure conviction.
