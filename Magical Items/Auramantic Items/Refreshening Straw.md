This tightly tied bundle of stiff enchanted threads possesses auramantic energy, which can be drained while placed in one's mouth. While chewing on the "straw", the creature may activate the item in order to draw recovering energy using a quick action to remove the [[Conditions#Decaying|decaying]] condition if applied by a curse of 1st level or below, or if the remaining duration of the [[Conditions#Decaying|decaying]] condition is 8 hours or less. After used, the straw may not be activated again until 1d4 hours pass.
