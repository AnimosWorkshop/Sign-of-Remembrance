This alchemical brass and gold wand, adorned with a beautiful sapphire at its top, is a special arcane spellcasting focus, able to amplify the resonance of spells cast by the attuned by tapping into the wand's charging power.
 
Being a wand, it provides a +1 bonus to the arcana modifier of the user, and is of the light weight category, allowing the user to draw it with a free hand without using actions when casting a spell with casting time of an action or higher.
 
_Potency_  
While a creature is attuned to the wand, they gain a +1 bonus to their arcana modifier.
 
_Functionality_  
The wand can contain up to 6 charges. When the attuned casts an arcana spell of a level lower than their maximum castable level, while holding the wand in hand, they may use up an amount of charges equal to the level of the cast spell + 1, in order to heighten the level of the spell cast by 1. This may be used any number of times.  
The wand regains 1d6 charges after the attuned finishes a long rest, and loses all charges when the creature deattunes from it.
