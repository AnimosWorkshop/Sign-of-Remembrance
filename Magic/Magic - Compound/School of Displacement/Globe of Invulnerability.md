You call upon a barrier so powerful it can withstand even the most brutal of forces, and the fiercest of creatures. As you create the barrier, you may designate any number of creatures according to a rule you choose (for example: "all humans can't pass", "these three people may pass", etc.). According to that rule, creatures may be able or unable to pass through the barrier. Every source of damage caused by a source in one side of the globe to the other side of the globe is nullified completely.
