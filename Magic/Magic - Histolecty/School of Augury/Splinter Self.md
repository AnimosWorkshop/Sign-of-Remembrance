#4th-Level #Histolecty #Augury #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You splinter your mind into two, allowing one instance to operate in your body as normal, and the other to exist ethereally outside of your body for up to 1000' away, though it originates at your current position. The ethereal self is a copy of yourself, but can only: move at a speed of 100' flying, see in both lightness and darkness, listen and talk. It cannot manipulate the physical world, nor can the physical world manipulate it, and it's not considered a creature for the purpose of targeting spells.  
In the end of the boon, the splinter returns to your body and merges back with your mind, granting you all memories gained during the boon's duration.
