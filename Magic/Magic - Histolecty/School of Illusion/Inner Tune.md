#3rd-Level #Histolecty #Illusion #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: 60'
- Duration: 1 minute  

By sowing a small seed of inspiration in up to four creatures you can see within range, the creatures are able to hear in their minds their inner tune - a piece of music which best expresses their current feeling. It changes and shifts as time goes on, and as events happen, which allows the creature to better synchronize with themselves. For the boon's duration, each creature gets a 1d8 bonus to concentration and reaction checks. In addition, they gain access to the Recoup quick action, which allows them to recover 1d8 hit points.
