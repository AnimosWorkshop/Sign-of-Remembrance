- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Self
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute  

You manage to create a spitting image of yourself, in an extremely close position to you, flickering in just the right way to make your exact position imperceivable. For the boon's duration, you have a +2 bonus to attack rolls, and whenever you are attacked or targeted by a spell which does not affect an area, the targeting creature must make a Wits saving throw or miss their target. However, if they succeed, you may use 2 reactions to choose to collapse the possibility deftly enough to get to the location of your split image - making it a miss, and ending the spell. If you do not collapse the spell, the targeting hits.
