You use your weapon in an especially violent manner, be it a piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon, potentially causing the shattering of the weapon to further harm your target. On a success, the weapon shatters completely. If the attack hits, you get a 1d4 piercing damage bonus to the attack's damage roll. This bonus scales with the Alchemical Affinity feature.
