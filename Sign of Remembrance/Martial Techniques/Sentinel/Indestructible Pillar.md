You anchor your body, sacrificing freedom of movement for stability. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you succeed on a saving throw against a negative effect, you halve its effectiveness:
* If the effect would damage you, halve that damage. 
* If the effect is not damaging, you instead halve its duration:
	* More than one round $\rightarrow$ halve the amount of rounds, etc.
	* Until the end of your turn $\rightarrow$ until the start of your turn
	* Until the start of your turn $\rightarrow$ instantaneous
