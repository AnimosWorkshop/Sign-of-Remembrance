- Performance Time: 1 attack
- Success DC: Perception (Wisdom), DC 10
- Required Weapon: Any thrown weapon or a weapon with the Ammunition trait with arrows or bolts
 
You throw or shoot a projectile directed to a creature's limbs in a way that hinders their movement and causes them to get stuck in a surface. On a success, if the attack hits, the enemy has to use half their base movement speed to free themselves from the ammunition. If the attack critically hits, the enemy had to spend their whole base movement to free themselves instead.
