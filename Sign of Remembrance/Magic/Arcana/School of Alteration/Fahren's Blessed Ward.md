You cast a ritual on a shield you are holding, and grant it affinity to magic. Fahren himself used a shield in his combat against monstrosities - and so should you. For the duration of the spell, while you hold the shield you have blessed, you may use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The duration of the boon is doubled for each spell level above 1st.
