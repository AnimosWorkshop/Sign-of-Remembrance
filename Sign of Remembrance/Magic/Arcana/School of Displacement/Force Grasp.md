You use ample force to pull your target towards, disorienting their balance. The target takes 6d6 force damage, and must make a Resilience saving throw. On a fail, they are moved up to 30' horizontally (your choice), applying half the original damage to the first creature or object hit in the way.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The target takes 1d6 additional force damage for each spell level above 3rd.
