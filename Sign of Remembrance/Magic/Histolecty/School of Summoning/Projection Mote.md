#3rd-Level #Histolecty #Summoning
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: 100'
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You summon a mote capable of projecting an image around it and attune to it, allowing it to project an image of yourself, though you may lightly change the clothing displayed. You instruct and command the mote telepathically as a quick action, or as a part of casting this spell. It can follow basic instructions such as "follow me" or "go there" without needing to do so over and over, but any changes to the command takes another quick action. However, when you take actions, such as attacking, talking or casting spells, you may have the projection seem as if it mimics your action without using quick actions. The mote may also mimic your sound.  
The mote may only stay within the spell's range. If it or you try to leave it, it sticks to the range's boundary. You may also turn the project on and off using a quick action, leaving only the mote in the place, which can still move even when the projection is turned off.  
When your image is supposed to take damage, the mote takes it. While it is manifested, creatures bound to you take a -1 penalty to AC and saving throws against you.
 
The mote's stats are as follows. When it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the mote vanishes.
