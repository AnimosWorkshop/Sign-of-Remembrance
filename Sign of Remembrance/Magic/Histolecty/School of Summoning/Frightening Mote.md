#4th-Level #Histolecty #Summoning
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30'
- Duration: 10 minutes
 
You summon an elemental mote, which appear as a tiny dull gray cloud, about the size of a palm. It can be moved and attached to a creature in the same space as itself as a part of casting the spell or using a quick action, which causes it to follow that creature to the best of their ability.  
While attached to a creature, they believe they start losing control over their body, losing their action and half their movement speed. A mote can only be attached to a creature which has no other frightening motes attached to them.  
In the end of the affected creature's turn, they may make a Wits saving throw. On a success, the mote detaches from them, and they are immune to Frightening Mote's effects for the next hour.
 
The motes' stats are as follows. When it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the mote vanishes.
