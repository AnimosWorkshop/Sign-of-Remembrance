- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30'
- Duration: 1 minute  

You summon a nefarious elemental mote, which appears as a tiny dark cloud, about the size of a palm. It can be moved and attached to a creature in the same space as itself as a part of casting this spell or using a quick action, which causes it to follow that creature to the best of their ability.  
While attached to a creature, they are must make a Wits saving throw at the start of their turn, or be forced to use the Attack action to make a weapon attack against a non-mote creature this turn if able. If there are no non-mote creatures in range to attack, the creature must use as much movement as they can to attempt to get into attack range. A mote can only be attached to a creature which has no other nefarious motes attached to them.
 
The mote's stats are as follows. When it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the mote vanishes.
