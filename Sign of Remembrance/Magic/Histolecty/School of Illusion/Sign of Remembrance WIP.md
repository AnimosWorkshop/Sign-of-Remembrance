_All things, good and bad, come to an end. Long after they're gone, we make icons of them. We refuse to forget what they meant to those who lived back then, and refuse to deny what them mean to us now. We all stand on the shoulders of giants, carried by their will to live, by their sacrifices. We will remember even if no one else will, and carry the coldflame to the last of days._
