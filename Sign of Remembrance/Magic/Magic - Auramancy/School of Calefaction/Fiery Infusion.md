#4th-Level #Auramancy #Calefaction #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 1 minute  

You cause a creature to exude fire from their body, which can be concentrated while focusing on certain actions. Whenever the booned creature attacks or uses a brawl action for the boon's duration, they build up fiery charges around them. Attacks generate 1 charge, and brawl actions generate 2 charges. As a quick action, they may release gathered charges against a creature within 10' of them as a spell attack using their auramancy modifier, dealing 1d8 per charge on a hit. The creature may hold up to 4 charges.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The booned creature may hold an additional charge for each spell level above 4th.
