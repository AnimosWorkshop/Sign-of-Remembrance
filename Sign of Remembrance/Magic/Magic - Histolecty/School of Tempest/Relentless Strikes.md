#2nd-Level #Histolecty #Tempest
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: Self
- Duration: Instantaneous  

Fast as the winds told of in the legends, you strike furiously, making three weapon attacks in a single action, all of them against histolectually bound creatures. The attacks are made as if you used the Attack action, meaning that, for example, you could switch some for grapples.
 
**At Higher Levels:** You make an additional attack for each spell level above 2nd.
