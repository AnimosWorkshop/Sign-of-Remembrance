#4th-Level #Histolecty #Augury #Boon
 
- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Self (the whole world)
- Duration: 1 minute  

You use a creature's unconsciousness to more easily slip into their minds. If they are unconscious, you become unconscious as well, and manage to see their dream yourself, and the dreaming creature sees you. For the boon's duration, you may communicate in any way you'd like during the dream, exiting the dream when the spell ends.  
If the creature is not unconscious when you cast this spell, the creature may decide to drop unconscious willingly for the boon's duration for the spell to work. If they refuse, the spell ends immediately.
