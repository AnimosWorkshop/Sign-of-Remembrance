- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Until dispelled
- Material Components: An object weighing no more than 0.1 lb  

You touch an object to imbue it with a vivid memory from your past, or the knowledge of a specific person or object. The next creature other than you to touch that object gets an immediate understanding of whatever you imbued onto the token, either seeing a vision of the memory, or coming to know the person or object from that point onward, allowing the creature to seek them using augury magic, such as with the [Locate Object](Locate%20Object.md) and [Message](Message.md) spells. The "memory token", so to speak, is then immediately dispelled from this spell's effect.
