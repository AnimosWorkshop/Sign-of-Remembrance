#2nd-Level #Arcana #Alteration
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: 15'
- Duration: 8 hours
- Material Components: 1 pint of water

You draw water from within range and alter its composition to create a thin membrane around it, and taint the water to make it more acidic. The created bomb, 0.3 lb in weight, is considered a [[Weapons#Simple Thrown Weapons|Simple Thrown weapon (Flask)]] of Light weight, which deals 5 times 1d6 acid damage and has the Thrown (20'/60'), Lethal 1, and Breaks on contact (100%) weapon traits. Who holds the bomb may also use their arcana modifier instead of their normal modifier for the weapon attack roll to throw it.  
When the duration ends, the membrane dissolves, and the water returns to its original state.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The bomb deals 1 more time 1d6 acid damage for each spell level above 2nd.
