You enhance the arcana field in your immediate surroundings for the duration of the spell. Any creature within that range gains a +1 bonus to their arcana modifier from the field. The field bonus generated by this spell may only increase the arcana modifier of the creature up to +1 if multiple fields are present.  
The field persists even if you don't stay within it.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The field bonus generated can be up to +1 higher than +1 for each spell level above 3rd, up to +3.
