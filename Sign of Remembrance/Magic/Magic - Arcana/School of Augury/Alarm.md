- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: Self
- Duration: 8 hours  

You designate your immediate surroundings within 20' from your location as you cast the spell as an area of utmost attention. For the duration, your senses heighten as long as you are within the designated area, allowing you to subconsciously notice minute details. You get a +2 bonus to Perception (Wisdom) and Investigation (Intelligence) checks when looking for objects or creatures within the selected area while you are in it.  

You also gain awareness as to whether creatures enter the area as you are in it, but you can designate up to 6 creatures which do not alarm you, in addition to a size of creatures, smaller than which do not alarm you. If any other creatures enter the area, you immediately gain awareness of the entrance (although not of the identity of the intruder), even when you are asleep, though it wakes you up.
