You create a two flat portals: one in an open space up to 10' away from you, and another in an open space within range, each portal being 10' in diameter. The portals face in a direction of your choice, yet it must be the same direction for both (entrance and exit is only possible from one side of the portals). Creatures and objects passing through one portal pass immediately through the other, increasing their momentum and pushing them away from the 'out' portal (up to 5' for medium sized, up to 10' for small sized and up to 15' for tiny sized), making it impossible to stay between two portals. Large and larger creatures and objects cannot pass through the portal.  

If a creature or object can't pass completely through the portal, can't pass through it at all. For example - a portal directly in front of a wall can't pass creatures and objects through.  
Projectiles thrown through a pulse portal have a +1 bonus to their attack roll.
