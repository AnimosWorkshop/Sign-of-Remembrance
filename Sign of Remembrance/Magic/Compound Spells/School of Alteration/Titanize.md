You use primal magic to become immense, doubling size in all dimensions and multiplying your weight by eight. This growth increases its size by one category, and if there isn't enough room for you to double your size, you attain the maximum possible size in the space available. You also get temporary hit points equal to your current hit points, up to 30. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Strength-based ability checks and Resilience saving throws. Your weapons and armor also grow to match its new size, matching the weapon size rules.
