- Casting Time: 4 hours
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Until dispelled  
Using magic, you make ghastly energy copy of a limb, wing or tail the creature you touch has lost. Aside from appearance, it functions just as the original limb did (though as if it has aged with the creature), and feels the same.  
Multiple uses of this spell on the same creature can restore multiple limbs, but not more than one of the same limb at the same time. For example, a creature can't recover an arm they've lost twice as long as one phantom hand still exists, but if that arm is dispelled, a new one may be created.
