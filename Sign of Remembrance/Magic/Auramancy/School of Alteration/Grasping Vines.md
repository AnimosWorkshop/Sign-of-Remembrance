You modify your arms to become stiff and infused with magic. As a part of casting the spell, you may make a brawl action, and additionally get the following benefits for the duration of the boon:

- As a quick action, you may make a brawl action. You may use your spellcasting modifier instead of your Athletics (Strength) for it.
- As a reaction to an enemy trying to break free from your grapple or topple, you may use your auramancy modifier instead of your Athletics (Strength) modifier.
- As a reaction to being forced to make a Resilience save against a brawl action, you may use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength modifier.
- When you make an attack of opportunity, you may choose to replace the attack with a grapple or shove. You may use your spellcasting modifier instead of your Athletics (Strength) modifier.
