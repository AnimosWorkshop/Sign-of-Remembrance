Performing a long ritual, you attempt to help a creature recover from a curse of this spell's level or lower, no matter its length. In the end of the ritual, the creature makes three saving throws against the curse's original save DC, each of them with advantage.  
On each fail, the creature loses hit points equal to the gap between their roll and the curse's DC. If they survive on more than 0 hit points, the curse is lifted.
