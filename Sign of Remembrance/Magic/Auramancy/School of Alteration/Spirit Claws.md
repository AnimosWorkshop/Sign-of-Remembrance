#2nd-Level #Auramancy #Alteration #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Self
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You alter the fingers of some or all of your hands to sharp claws. While your hands are in this form, you may not hold items, but your unarmed attacks have a base damage die of 1d8 slashing, and has the natural and light attributes as per usual.  
You may use a quick action to revert back to your fingers' normal form, or convert them back, while the boon lasts.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The claws' base damage die increases by 2 for each spell level above 2nd.
