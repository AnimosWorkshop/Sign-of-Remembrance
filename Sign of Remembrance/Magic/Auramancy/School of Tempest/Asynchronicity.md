#4th-Level #Auramancy #Tempest #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Self
- Duration: 1 minute  

You infuse your nerves in such a way which allows you to move out of sync with the normal biological flow of creatures. At the start of each round starting from the next one for the boon's duration, you may choose to change your turn initiative in combat to any value from your Initiative modifier + 1 to your Initiative modifier + 20, instead of taking your turn during your normal initiative order.

In case of contested initiative in the case of a tie with another creature, you may use your Auramancy modifier instead of your Initiative modifier if that would make you go before them.
