This legendary scepter from the end of the First Verse was crafted by [Tezix, the Shifter](Tezix,%20the%20Shifter), himself, and was later used as the key to his chamber in his main temple in central Maingrat. The sword was traditionally kept as the archbishop's possession, before the Sealing occurred, though an earthquake that ensued during it caused the temple to become ruins, trapping the sword and its wielder inside. Only in the year 1274 PS, the new archbishop of Tezix - Sanae, claimed Gale to her possession and continued the cycle.
 
As a [[Spell Foci|scepter]], Gale is also a [[Weaponsmith#Simple Melee Weapons|mace]], dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage and having the Tool (Sorcery) weapon property.
 
_Potency_  
Gale grants the attuned a +3 bonus to their arcana modifier.
 
_Functionality_  
After casting a spell with a casting time of an action, the attuned may use their quick action to attack with Gale as if their action was used on the Attack action.
 
_Property_  
The attuned may use their action in order to execute a booming slash on the ground, forcing all creatures within a 30' cone in front of them to make a Resilience saving throw against your arcana DC, or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be pushed backward to beyond the cone. They take half damage instead on a success and are not knocked back. This may be used once per long rest before having to recharge. Since the sword was specially made for Tezix's bishops, this bonus is augmented by the attuned's rank in Tezix's hierarchy: A bishop may use this feature up to twice per long rest, while an archbishop may use it up to thrice per long rest.  
This counts as 3rd-Level, Arcana, Tempest for the purpose of magic detection, and for this item's functionality upgrade.
