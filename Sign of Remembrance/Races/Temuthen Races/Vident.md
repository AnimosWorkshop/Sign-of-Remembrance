#Race #Temuthen

_Vidents are considered to be folks of knowledge, able to assess situations with impeccable wisdom. Worldly myths surround them, some linking them to the ancient Vorona who was born of the same race, calling them 'seeing ones'. Many settlements welcome vidents, hoping that their knowledge will improve their well-being, and so they are spread far and wide all across Temuthan._
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Your Wisdom increases by 2.  
**Age:** Mature at early teens, live about 180 years.  
**Size:** Medium.  
**Appearance:** Vidents are on average a bit shorter than humans. Their skin color ranges from leathery beige in inquisitive vidents to smoother green in grove vidents, with two very small blunt horns which come out of their foreheads. Their appetite often makes them thinner than humans, although this is cultural, and can be nurtured otherwise.  
**Creature Type:** Temuthen.  
**Speed:** 30' walking.  
**Vision:** Lightvision.  
**Instinctive Insight:** You are adept with Insight. In addition, once per short or long rest, as a reaction to being attacked, after the roll is declared but before damage is dealt, you may make a reaction check. If you succeed, make an Insight (Wisdom) check. The result becomes your AC against that attack.  
**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Temuthen.

## Subraces
### Grove Vident
 
_Grove vident society has magic and spellcasting at its center, as it encourages the teachings of magic from young age. Their communal and parental approach to teaching leads many vidents, even when they grow older and leave their home, to recall that feeling of being together and discovering the wonders of the world together. Travelers across the land might go once in awhile to a grove vidents' village in order to witness their beautiful rituals which decorate the night air with bright colors and feel the inspiring atmosphere._
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Two different attribute scores of your choice other than Wisdom increase by 1.  
**Magical Affinity:** You are novice with Sorcery, and know one 1st level spell of your choice.  
**Council's Aid:** When you cast a spell, you may recall the memories from your home: the joy, the feasts, the group sittings and the teachings of the elder to the youth. You use those memories to empower your magic, giving you a bonus to your spellcasting modifier for that casting equal to your Wisdom modifier. You may use this feature once per long rest.
 
### Inquisitive Vident
 
_Inquisitive vidents have a harder time than most other races to keep their kind united. Their natural curiosity and ability to influence others is a nice thing to have, for sure, but not something one would generally want to be used against them. Of course, their skill is useful as a whole, which lets them find success in those work fields, and many become investigators and researchers, but it is rare to find an inquisitive vident with more than a handful of friends with the same qualities as them._
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.  
**Combative Insight:** You may use your Instinctive Insight feature offensively - when you make an attack, you may use the feature's charge to make an Insight (Wisdom) check. The result becomes your attack roll.  
**Lone Wolf:** While you have no allies within 5' of you, you get +1 to attack and damage rolls, ability checks (and their DC's), saving throws and AC.  
**Natural Curiosity:** You are proficient with two skills. In addition, you are either proficient with a tool of your choice, or can speak, read and write in a language of your choice.
