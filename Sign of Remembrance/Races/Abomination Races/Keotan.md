**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 1, and your Wisdom and Charisma scores decrease by 1.  
**Age:** Keotans become more stable than before, aging about 1.5 times slower than their standard race does.  
**Size:** Medium.  
**Appearance:** Created by a destructive force, magic tore apart their physical form while hardening the remaining body parts. They look similar to both air and earth elementals, but their bodies have a tarnished silvery texture to them, especially in the head and neck and on their limbs. Though only their fists and their calves and feet remain, their hands and legs are held in place by holding it through the arcane web by a tether, allowing them to move them further than they normally would as their standard race. Even when they open their mouth to speak, their voice is raspy, making clear the changes they've been through.  
**Creature Type:** Abomination.  
**Curse Magic Type:** Arcane.  
**Speed:** 10' less than your standard race.  
**Vision:** Same as you had in your standard race.  
**Disconnected Limbs:** Due to your limbs being held to the rest of its body using arcane force, you are able to extend them further than they usually would. You may reach 5' further, including for melee attacks and touch spells, is increased by 5', but your damage is decreased by 1 when attacking this way.  
**Propel:** As an attack, you throw your attack further away by momentarily disconnecting the attraction force to it, then flies with the momentum as it returns. You performs a melee weapon attack with its range extended by 10' or by only 5' for heavy weapons. Then, you move 5' in the direction of the attack, having attacks of opportunities against you being made with disadvantage during this movement. You may use this feature a number of times up to 2 + your Constitution modifier per long rest (at least once).  
**Tether Focus:** Your own body serves as an arcane focus on its own, but you must stay attuned to it in order to be able to move it, lest the tether between its torso and its limbs is disconnected, nullifying any ability to act upon or feel the limbs.
