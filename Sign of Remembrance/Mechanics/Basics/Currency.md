Currency is made of metals, from the low cost copper to the highly coveted platinum. Coins are made out of purely the metal, and are also considered a weight unit, weighing 1/50 of 1 pound. Those who fancy themselves a coin collection might pay metalworkers to refine their coins and decorate them, making them worth more as they rival pieces of art, yet most people settle for not very clear-cut or refined pieces of metal. The value of metals is as follows:
 
| **Metal** | **Value / lb** | **Value / coin** |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Gold      | 50 gc          | 1 gc             |
| Silver    | 50 sc          | 1 sc             |
| Copper    | 50 cc          | 1 cc             |
 
100 cc = 1 sc  
100 sc = 1 gc
