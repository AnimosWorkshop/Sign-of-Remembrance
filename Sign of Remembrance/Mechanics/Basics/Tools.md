If you are proficient with a tool, you can craft with it to your heart's content, without a crafting check of any kind required. 
If you would need to roll a knowledge check for that tool, or want to earn income using your tool, use your Intelligence modifier + twice your proficiency modifier as your bonus to the roll. [[Proficiency and Downtime#Earn Income|Earn Income]] may also be used to reduce the cost of items you craft using the tool, according to the amount of money you would earn using that tool.

Tools may have a specific attribute associated with them for the purposes of earning income, which can (but not must) be used instead of Intelligence:
- **Strength:** Weaponsmith
- **Dexterity:** Armorer
- **Wisdom:** Alchemist, Provisioner
- **Casting Modifier** (if the character is a caster): Runecarver
 
#### Alchemist
Alchemy is usually considered the spearhead of technology, using the mixing of materials and chemicals in order to create concoctions, poisons and more. Alchemist's tools include: a set of vials and alembics, a gas grill, a retort and a pestle and mortar.
 
#### Armorer
Armorers use skins, hides of creatures (although, mostly limited for beasts for sane folk) and metals of different kinds in order to make clothes, armor, saddles and covers for various items such as sword handles. The tools include: a skinning dagger, a jagged rock to clean skins, in addition to string and a sewing kit. They also need to have some workstations, such as a tanning rack or forge, in order to process these materials.

#### Provisioner
Provisioners know where to get the right things from the right people in order to properly craft or improvise any required item for adventurers on the road. The provisioner's tools include a sewing kit, bags or small sacks, strings, scissors and pins of different sizes
 
#### Runecarver
Runecarvers use specially crafted sigils called 'runes' in order to modify items with magical properties. It is a difficult art to master, involving extreme focus and knowledge, which results in a relatively small amount of people practicing it compared to other professions. The tools one would use include: a stabilizing apparatus, a special chisel, and the item itself.
 
#### Weaponsmith
Weaponsmiths forge weapons, be it out of wood, metal or any other material required. It requires physical fitness and finesse in order to correctly hit and mold the material, and create a functional object. As most of the necessary tools, such as an anvil and a forge, are to heavy to carry, most smiths travel with a hammer, a tough sander, a saw and a sharpening stone in order to operate on the road.
