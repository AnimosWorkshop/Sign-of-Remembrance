Creatures sometime make the choice to ride a bigger creature during combat. Usually this is done in order to increase their own speed, be able to control the creature on which they are riding, or move with them in order to protect and work together. Whatever the reason may be, this requires an adjustment to the rules in order to explain how the action economy works under those conditions.
 
### The Rider
 
- May take their movement as normal if not mounted.
- Mounting or dismounting cost half the rider's base movement speed to perform.
 
### The Ridee
 
- Their turn is taken with the mounted creature, unless their turn already occurred in the same round (may happen if the rider is switched).
- Their movement is determined by the rider if trained, and by themselves if not.
- Unless trained well to do so or are sentient enough creatures themselves, they may not take their action unless their rider uses their action to issue it.
- An untrained mount can choose not to act according to its rider's will, and might even attempt to drop the rider forcefully. This is requires an action which the mount can choose to take, and functions similarly to the shove action. On a failed save, the rider takes the fall damage and is prone.
- Reactions may only be taken if the mount wants to or is trained to do so.
- **Note:** The mount creature still has its own health pool! If the mount drops to 0 hit points, the rider must make a Dexterity save with DC 12 in order to not fall prone if the mount is not flying, and fall damage (in case the mount was flying) is issued as normal, with the rider falling prone.
