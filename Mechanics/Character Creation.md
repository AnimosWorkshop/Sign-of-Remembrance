## Ability Scores
 
Ability scores may be generated in one of two ways, determined by the game master. In general, Point-Buy is recommended most, since its variance is much smaller than the Random method's:
 
### Method 1 - Random
 
Ability scores are generated using a stat-rolling system. Each result will be called a "value", and 7 values will be called a "set".  
In order to generate a value, roll the following: 6 + 1d4 + 1d6. By this system, the minimum generated value can be 8, and the maximum can be 16, although most values fall between 12 and 14.  
In order to generate a set, roll 9 values and remove two of them of your choice to generate your set. Those can be the lowest values, and you will not be blamed for doing so, but note that some characters shine through their weaknesses. Then, reorder the values as you wish.
 
*An optional rule for more merciful game masters is to not count a stat rolling if all 9 values were below 13, which allows for more "heroic heroes". Alternatively, they can simply buff some of the rolls, etc.
 
### Method 2 - Point-Buy
 
Each character starts with a total of 36 points, which can be distributed in any way they want across the 7 attributes. All attributes start at 8, and points may be used in the following way:

- 8 to 14 - costs 1 point per increase
- 14 to 15 - costs 2 points, plus another 1 point for each stat already above 14
- 15 to 16 - costs 2 points

## Race
 
Choose one of the available races, which can be found in the home page. If the race contains subraces, choose one of them. You gain all traits, features and ability score bonuses listed under your race and subrace.  
According to the game setting, a game master might choose to limit which races can be played. For example, a good rule of thumb is to not allow dragon player characters, due to the race having obviously better features than other races, with the exception of not being able to level up until hitting the next age category, which becomes problematic when considering the flow of a campaign.

## Background
 
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Character Level**|**Proficiency Points to Spend**|**Starting Budget**|
|0th|8 + Intelligence Modifier|80 sc|
|1st|9 + Intelligence Modifier|1 gc|
|2nd|12 + Intelligence Modifier|3 gc|
|3rd|15 + Intelligence Modifier|6 gc|
|4th|18 + Intelligence Modifier|10 gc|
|5th|21 + Intelligence Modifier|15 gc|
|6th|24 + Intelligence Modifier|21 gc|
|7th|27 + Intelligence Modifier|28 gc|
|8th|30 + Intelligence Modifier|36 gc|
|9th|33 + Intelligence Modifier|45 gc|
|10th|36 + Intelligence Modifier|55 gc|
 
As implied in this table, it is recommended to provide characters with about 3 PP per level, according to the GM's discretion. Providing more PP allows player to cap their proficiencies more quickly, which in turn allows them to learn more spells and techniques, and craft items, or get paid while working in downtime.

## Level and Class
 
You start at 0th level, without a class. This level serves as an introduction to the game, having only base health and your background proficiencies as features. The Size Hit Points are determined by your size - 4 for tiny creatures, 6 for small, 8 for normal, 10 for large, 12 for huge and 20 for gargantuan:

- Hit Die: None
- Hit Points: Size Hit Points + your Constitution modifier + your Willpower modifier

This is a temporary state for more adventures, and your GM will decide at which point everyone gets to level up, finally pick up a class and truly start their adventure.
 
On each of your level ups, you may take a level in any class you fulfill the prerequisites to. For example, leveling up to 1st level allows you to choose any of the "base" classes, while "prestige" classes an amount of levels to already be invested in other classes, like the partisan class which can only be taken after 3 other levels have been invested in any other class. Other prerequisites might be, for example, an ability score requirement or training in a specific skill.
 
Classes give features, according to the class page, including an initial set of proficiencies such as weapons, armor and skills. One of the common class features is a maximum hit points increase per class level, and a hit die. Hit dice are used in short rests and for coagulation concoctions, as written in the Rest and Hit Dice page.

## Equipment
 
Each character starts with a starting budget, according to the table in the Background segment, and the following basic equipment:

- Backpack
- Bedroll
- Common clothes
- Waterskin
 
Though the most necessary gear can be found in the Mundane Items section, in the Adventuring Gear page, other items are also available – between the other pages in the Mundane Items section, such as the Armor, Tools and Weapons pages, as well as items in the Crafting section.
 
The separation between the Mundane Items and the Crafting sections is mostly order – the Mundane Items section lists item by common use, while the Crafting section lists item according to the tool required to make them. These items are still fairly common and can be bought in big markets, and the listing under the Crafting section should not be an obstacle in the process of obtaining them.
