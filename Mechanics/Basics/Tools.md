If you are proficient with a tool, you can craft with it to your heart's content, without a crafting check of any kind required. 
If you would need to roll a knowledge check for that tool, or want to earn income using your tool, use your Intelligence modifier + twice your proficiency modifier as your bonus to the roll. [[Proficiency and Downtime#Earn Income|Earn Income]] may also be used to reduce the cost of items you craft using the tool, according to the amount of money you would earn using that tool.

Tools may have a specific attribute associated with them for the purposes of earning income, which can (but not must) be used instead of Intelligence:
- **Strength:** Smith, Woodworker
- **Dexterity:** Artist, Clothier
- **Constitution:** Alchemist
- **Casting Modifier** (if the character is a caster): Runecarver
 
#### Alchemist
Alchemy is usually considered the spearhead of technology, using the mixing of materials and chemicals in order to create concoctions, poisons and more. Alchemist's tools include: a set of vials and alembics, a gas grill, a retort and a pestle and mortar.
 
#### Artist
Artist's tools are used for both writing, drawing, and crafting martial technique manuals and magical scrolls, given the knowledge and materials. Some warriors also use calligraphy as a method of expression that is used to enhance their abilities in the battlefield, as a way to channel their inner energy; others might use it to document the people and views they see; and some might even use the artists' tools to make maps. Such tools include: a set of parchment, an ink bottle (or ink bottles of different colors), a set of quills and a sponge.
 
#### Clothier
Clothiers use skins, hides of creatures (although, mostly limited for beasts for sane folk) and cloth of different kinds in order to make clothes, armor, saddles and covers for various items such as sword handles. The tools include: a skinning dagger, a jagged rock to clean skins, a folding wooden rack and pins, in addition to string and a sewing kit.
 
#### Runecarver
Runecarvers use specially crafted sigils called 'runes' in order to modify items with magical properties. It is a difficult art to master, involving extreme focus and knowledge, which results in a relatively small amount of people practicing it compared to other professions. The tools one would use include: a stabilizing apparatus, a special chisel, and the item itself.
 
#### Smith
Smiths forge weapons, armor and tools out of metal. It requires physical fitness and finesse in order to correctly hit and mold the material, and create a functional object. As most of the necessary tools, such as an anvil and a forge, are to heavy to carry, most smiths travel with a hammer and a tough sander in order to operate on the road.
 
#### Woodworker
Woodworkers use the natural material of wood in order to either construct or carve various objects, ranging from arrow shafts and bows to beautiful furniture. Woodworkers of a larger scale use large saws and need a larger setup, while those traveling might find a handsaw, a phial and a set of knives and scalpels more handy.
