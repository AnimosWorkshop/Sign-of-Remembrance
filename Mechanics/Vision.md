Many types of vision exist across the worlds. In order to understand it, we must first acknowledge how the concepts of light, and darkness, work. Contrary to what we have in the real world, light and darkness are both energy - darkness is not simply lack of light. These two types of energy cancel each other, which can results in three states:

- Lightness - a state in which there is light energy.
- Darkness - a state in which there is dark energy.
- Nullness - a state in which light and dark energies balanced each other out.

Magic can cause light or dark energy to appear. Magical light and dark cancel each other just as nonmagical light and dark do, but they overpower their nonmagical counterpart. In time, as the magical effects end, the magical light and dark turn into nonmagical light and dark.  
Note that flames can be either hotflames (emitting light) or coldflames (emitting dark), and there are torches corresponding to both.
### Lightvision
 
Most creatures possess lightvision - one that is affected by light, allows the bearer to see in light, but not see in darkness. The vision type is affected like so by different vision conditions:

- Lightness - no hindrances to Perception (Wisdom) checks.
- Nullness - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with a -2 penalty. Color is duller than usual.
- Darkness - Perception (Wisdom) checks and attack rolls are made with disadvantage as sight is almost non-effective.
- Mist, smoke, etc. - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with a -2 penalty.
- Fog - Perception (Wisdom) checks and attack rolls are made with disadvantage as sight is almost non-effective.
### Darkvision
 
Many creatures which nowadays live in deep dark places, or are nocturnal, possess darkvision - one that is affected by the lack of light, allows the bearer to see in darkness, but not see in light. The vision type is affected like so by different vision conditions:

- Lightness - Perception (Wisdom) checks and attack rolls are made with disadvantage as sight is almost non-effective.
- Nullness - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with a -2 penalty. Color is duller than usual.
- Darkness - no hindrances to Perception (Wisdom) checks.
- Mist, smoke, etc. - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with a -2 penalty.
- Fog - Perception (Wisdom) checks and attack rolls are made with disadvantage as sight is almost non-effective.
### Nullvision
 
Some creatures, such as the undead of Dahrial, lack the ability to see in large amounts of both light and dark, instead feeling small changes in both. That makes them great information gatherers in neutral vision conditions around nullness, but intolerant to both light and dark. The vision type is affected like so by different vision conditions:

- Lightness - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with a -2 penalty. Color is duller than usual.
- Nullness - no hindrances to Perception (Wisdom) checks.
- Darkness - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with a -2 penalty. Color is duller than usual.
- Mist, smoke, etc. - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with a -2 penalty.
- Fog - Perception (Wisdom) checks and attack rolls are made with disadvantage as sight is almost non-effective.
### Mistvision
 
Some creatures, living in terrain types which contain a lot of fog clouds and mist, developed a vision capable of sensing through it. It is a rare feat, which can be utilized in both hunting parties and military tactics. This vision is accompanied by another vision type, and is affected normally by them. The only conditions change for those who possess it are:

- Mist, smoke, etc. - no hindrances to Perception (Wisdom) checks for up to 60' away, after which they are made with disadvantage.
- Fog - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with disadvantage.
### Tremorsense
 
Very rarely, creatures possess the ability to sense through the ground, as they feel the trembles of the ground and are able to trace their source. This vision is affected like so by different ground conditions:

- Solid ground - no hindrances to Perception (Wisdom) checks within 30', after which the creature is effectively blind.
- Grain ground, muddy ground, etc. - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with disadvantage up to 30' away, after which the creature is effectively blind.
- Liquids, gasses, etc. - Perception (Wisdom) checks automatically fail, and the creature is effectively blind.
### True Sight
 
Nature has blessed few with the ability to sense every surface in their surroundings, using sound navigation ranging. As it uses their hearing as their source of sight, they would be considered effectively blind when deaf. But, since they don't use light to see, they might not sense color or light coming to them, but they are able to "see" vividly up to 30' away from them and ignore illusions in this range, after which the creature is effectively blind.
