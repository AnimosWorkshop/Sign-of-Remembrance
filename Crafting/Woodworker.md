| Clutch Weapon (wooden)         | 250 sc                | -           | _Functionality_  <br>The weapon manages to yield good results in the most difficult situations. For each 1 or 2 rolled on the weapon's own damage dice (not bonus damage), roll another die of the same type. This effect doesn't chain (a 1 after another 1 doesn't result in another die roll).                    |
| Durable Object (wooden)        | 80 sc                 | 0.1 lb      | _Property_  <br>This object is more durable than others. When it would break, roll a flat check with DC 11. On a success, the item does not break.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Flourish Ammunition (wooden)   | 11 sc each            | -           | _Functionality_  <br>When powering a weapon which uses the appropriate ammunition, the weapon's damage die size is increased by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

For Ammunition weapons, only increases the non-firing damage die (for example, smacking someone with a crossbow).                                                                                                                               |
| Kinetic Weapon (wooden)        | 240 sc / 48 sc (dart) | -           | _Functionality_  <br>This weapon uses the wielder's momentum as they strike, dealing 1 additional damage for each 10' moved previously on the current turn since the last attack performed with this weapon. Back-and-forth movement does not count.                                                                 |
| Reckless Weapon (wooden)       | 2 gc                  | -           | _Functionality_  <br>Increases the enchanted weapon's Fragile and Lethal traits potency by 1. It is said that those who use such weapons intend to taunt Vorona.                                                                                                                                                     |
